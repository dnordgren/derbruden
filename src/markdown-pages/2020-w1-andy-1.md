Howdy Partners,

The start of the season was not as great for my team as last year, but according to IBM Watson my team should coast to a fifth straight playoff appearance. Speaking of IBM Watson I’m pretty sure the FBI should open a sexual assault investigation on him considering how often he suggests that I trade rape everyone in the league. Luckily come next weekend those sick fucks at IBM will have their thirst for blood quenched when my team does unspeakable things to Derek’s slovenly band of misfits.

On the home front things are looking up. I’ve been spending the last few months unemployed and living at my parents house, but earlier this week I accepted a general surgery job in New York at a hospital that’s pretty close to where Charlotte is working. I’ll still be in Nebraska until November so I’m sure we’ll all get together to celebrate Derek’s return to the States. Good luck to everyone in the league this year and lets hope COVID-19 doesn’t cut it short.

Forever Yours,

Andrew Nitz
