Greetings,

As you all got the great satisfaction of watching, it was a heartwrenching first week for The Little Engine That Couldn’t, despite poorly calculated projected totals that sent his hopes souring on eagles wings. It appears sending a voodoo doll to my house in the mail as a gift, already coated with your own DNA, has revealed itself a timely, and unfortunate mistake. Log in this week to see your reigning Champion get tuned up worse than if Jordan, a capitalist pig, put up a weed pen stand in the CHAZ wearing his freshest MAGA.

As for me, I keep on truckin’ like the doo-dah man, an inter-dimensional traveler bound not by time or space, beaming through a cruel, and ever changing universe. I long for the day I get to see all of your soft, disarming smiles again, not plagued by the dark, low-frequency forces of the Chinese Death. In the next week, I’m planning to install new Air intake, fuel tuner and Vance and Hines exhaust system on my Millenium Harley Falcon. I’m not sure if the pipes I got are actually street legal without the baffles, but regardless I plan to drive it straight over to Rudy Miles house and give a rev so powerful it will knock the windows out of the Debbie Van. We will then embrace in a powerful grip, and he will admit in tears, to the man I have become.

"Desire Nothing, Give Up All Desires and Be Happy"

Hare Krishna,

Cole
