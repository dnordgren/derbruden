All,

I’m just here to say hello and rip into this 2020 season like a 9 year old, foaming at the mouth on Christmas morning. Derek mentioned me having something in store, but really I’m just gonna roll one off the top in my opening email of the 2020 season. It’s always nice to face Small Town Shanahan week 1. It’s like Alabama playing Nicholls State. Or Coastal Carolina playing Kansas. Either way, it’s just good to start 1-0. I see some of you out here already trying to tear your teams down and rebuild after week 1. Keep your noses to the grind stone. The diaper will choose you if it so wishes. I really don’t have much to say at the time. Was looking forward to seeing what’s been going on with you all. Congrats to Andy on the new gig. You’ve become Billy Joel before our eyes. Josh, I’ve got you locked in this week. Hopefully your children and wife know how much you love them, because come Sunday, it’s your reckoning. Also, very happy for my brother, for all he’s accomplished this year. Good thing fantasy football didn’t care about all of that when it gifted you Mark Ingram in the 4th round.

Raunch out
