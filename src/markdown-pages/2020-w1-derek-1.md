Brothers,

Lord Almighty I'm glad it's football season once more. Some of us are sporting new team names but the things I love about our league never seem to change – Zach drafting auto pick, borderline collusion trades before the first kickoff, Dalton hating on my RB selection and not least the Lady Killers once again starting off hot. As we all know one week a season does not make but seeing two previous champs score 90 or less warms my heart.

On a personal note, Ellen and I are gearing up to fly back to the US in a few weeks. We haven't been back since last Christmas but are really excited to be home for a while. We'll be in Lincoln from Oct 9-26. If any of you will be around hit me up.

Let me know about these emails – open to feedback on whether they should be weekly or bi-weekly, if I should have some kind of prompt each week, etc.

And don't forget that the competition's on for the fantasy party. Lt. Raunch and Alec's poetic tour de force will be hard to top but I have no doubt they will be by this year's masterworks. Judging by Dalton's eagerness he's already got something spicy cooking for us.

Yours in truth,

--Derek
