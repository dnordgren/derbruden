Mein Bruden,

Despite taking the reins of a franchise in shambles, it appears the changes made to our organizationâ€™s culture over the last year have begun to bear fruit. After eviscerating a perennial favorite in Week 1, our team is looking forward to recovering during our upcoming BYE week while preparing for the rest of the tough season ahead.

Out on the west coast we continue to enjoy smokey skies from our smoldering forests and cities, as well as the pernicious erosion of our societal institutions. God willing, I look forward to seeing you all again in the corn filled fields of the heartland.

Auf wiedersehen,
Jordan
