Dearest fellas,

I have received your letters in good health. The last few nights have been grueling, however. While the sun has shined bright, the rains continue to evade us as a Nuk evades a drop. We were relegated to sitting by and watching as our comrades in the Jaguar unit were decimated by the fiendish Dolphin brigade. Sergeant Minshew, I’m afraid, was lost in the battle. Though the battle brought about much scourge, we ride into dawn with the wind at our backs and a young undrafted private in our ranks. Our clash on the horizon, is with that of the Lady Killers. We’ve yet to figure the essence of the name, as they are neither Casanovas nor nefarious murderers, though in our recent battles with them, we’ve lost good men. They consider us rivals, and have always come into a fight with hard noses and light feet. And, while important in the tide of the war, this skirmish is not considered to be a large speed bump on our way to a third world victory. As, ultimately, they’ve yet to taste the succulent tang of victory on their tongues.

We remain keen while we await the arrival of a new Sergeant, Staff Sergeant Rodgers. I pray that you all continue to be blessed with the fruits of your labor. I’ve obtained some nice stuff we were able to collect off the Shanahans from Small Town, I’ll be sending with this letter. Tell your girls I say hello. I look forward to joining you all in a few months when the smoke settles and the ship lines are moored.

Bless your souls

Raunch
