Rivalry week has come early this season for the Lady Killers.

Lt. Raunch has scorned our RB selection for two seasons running. He's demeaned us with his repeated, sleazy trade requests. He's maligned us in the league press at length with his talk of "teaching lessons of humility" or "disemboweling, dismembering, and disfiguring" our men.

But we know his talk to be cheap. We quietly, efficiently and confidently walloped the Raunch in all three of our contests last year and have another drubbing in store for him this weekend. He feels good about himself with his early advantage but any spear tipped by Jacksonville Jaguars is destined to break upon our shield. We know him for the bawdy, Bronco-supportin', trade-renegin' scoundrel that he is.
