Hark! Ye wily old scavengers,

Tis I, with a blood-stained nostrils

And hops and barley on thee breath!

Thee Raunchy One!

I come to thee, my crew of rude chums

With news of ample measure

The email chain has awoken

And unto thee it shall return great favor

Thou shall come upon it throughout your fantasy football travels

As thou commissioner hath revived said treasure

Due to the secretary being a lousy English fuck

Go now!

Sing to it, thee praises!

Breathe life into it, as I have

Look to thee neighboring comrade

Belittle them

Desecrate their yearnings

And let us, as one

Continue to build

Animosity towards our un-retired brethren

Aaaawwwwmen,

Raunch
