      If this file exists, we should include it using Nunjucks.
      If it was a placeholder, we leave a comment.
      I'll assume it might exist in src/_includes/stubs/ if I move it there, 
      or I can just leave a TODO if the file is missing.
      For now, I'll comment it out or try to include it if I can find where it is.
